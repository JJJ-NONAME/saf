"""Headless "run" tests for example apps.

Each ``example_*.py`` file under ``examples/`` (including ``examples/gallery_apps/``
and ``examples/user_guide/``) is automatically discovered via the
``pytest_generate_tests`` hook in ``conftest.py``.

Run tests verify that:

* The Dash application server starts without raising an exception.
* The ``/_dash-layout`` endpoint returns HTTP 200, confirming the app is
  healthy and its layout can be serialised.

The tests do **not** open a browser, interact with the UI, or assert anything
about the rendered HTML — that level of testing is left to dedicated end-to-end
tests.  Callback errors are also not checked here: they are only triggered when
the UI is loaded and interacted with, which is outside the scope of these
headless tests.

Implementation note
-------------------
``app.run()`` starts a blocking Werkzeug server and cannot be stopped from
another thread, so we use ``werkzeug.serving.make_server`` instead.  This
gives us a handle whose ``shutdown()`` method can be called from the test
thread after the assertions, keeping each test self-contained.
