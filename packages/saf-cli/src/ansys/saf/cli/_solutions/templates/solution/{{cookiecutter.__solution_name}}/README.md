# Install the solution

This assumes that SAF CLI is installed and the ``saf`` command is available in the terminal. Therefore, it is not strictly required to run the following commands from any directory in particular.

1. Run the ``saf install`` command with the ``<solution_name>`` argument. By default, it will install ``desktop`` and ``ui`` dependency groups.

```bash
saf install {{ cookiecutter.__solution_name }}
```

Check the [Install solution’s development environment](https://saf-cli.external.solutions.ansys.com/version/stable/user_guide/install_solution_environment.html) section of the SAF CLI documentation for more options.

# Start the solution

To start the solution run the following command anywhere in the system:

```bash
saf run {{ cookiecutter.__solution_name }}
```

Check the [Run a solution](https://saf-cli.external.solutions.ansys.com/version/stable/user_guide/run.html) section of the SAF CLI documentation for more options.

# Generate a distributable desktop installer

To generate an executable installer from the solution application:

1. Install the build dependencies:

```bash
saf install {{ cookiecutter.__solution_name }} -d build
```

2. Run the ``saf build`` command:

```bash
saf build {{ cookiecutter.__solution_name }}
```

Check the [Build a distributable installer](https://saf-cli.external.solutions.ansys.com/version/stable/user_guide/installer.html) section of the SAF CLI documentation for more options.
